One may want to use external libraries that Bazel does not manage when using Bazel.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-1878"></span><span class="easy-footnote">[<sup>1</sup>](https://komorinfo.com/blog/en/use-non-bazel-libraries-in-bazel-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-1878 "Q.

To use local files in Bazel, one can use `new_local_repository`. <span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-1878"></span><span class="easy-footnote">[<sup>2</sup>](https://komorinfo.com/blog/en/use-non-bazel-libraries-in-bazel-project/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-1878 "To use remote files managed by Git <code>build_file</code> or <code>build_file_content</code> in <code>git_repository</code> can be used the same way as this page. (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/repo/git#git_repository-build_file_content" target="_blank">ref</a>)")</span>

`new_local_repository` is a function that can be used in WORKSPACE files, which adds a BUILD file virtually and make a local directory Bazel project. One can specify the BUILD file by the option `build_file` or`build_file_content`. For example, if one wants to use OpenSSL in its local storage, a sample code with `build_file` is the following:

```
# WORKSPACE.bazel
new_local_repository(
  name = "openssl",
  path = "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@3/3.0.5",
  build_file = "openssl.BUILD",
)
```

```
# openssl.BUILD
cc_library(
  name = "lib",
  hdrs = glob(["include/**/*.h"]),
  srcs = glob(["lib/*.dylib"]),
  strip_include_prefix = "include",
  visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

A sample code with `build_file_content` is the following:

```
# WORKSPACE.bazel
new_local_repository(
  name = "openssl",
  path = "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@3/3.0.5",
  build_file_content = """
cc_library(
  name = "lib",
  hdrs = glob(["include/**/*.h"]),
  srcs = glob(["lib/*.dylib"]),
  strip_include_prefix = "include",
  visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)""",
)
```

In the latter case, one needs to set proper indents, or it will not be recognized as a correct BUILD file.
